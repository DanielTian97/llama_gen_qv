They ask about various aspects of goldfish growth, such as size, potential for growth, average size, factors that affect growth, etc. Some reformulations are more specific (e.g., \"Can you make goldfish bigger?\"), while others are more generic (e.g., \"What is the average size of a goldfish?\"). \n\nNote: These reformulations were generated by an experienced searcher and may not be exhaustive or perfect. The goal was to create 10 different ways to rephrase the original query that still have similar information needs. "
